1) In order to import the CSV to a dataframe we used different encodings.
2) We converted the InvoiceDate to datetime format.
3) In the Description Column we filled the missing values with the value 'Unknown Product'.
4) In the Country Column we filled the missing values with the value 'Unspecified'.
5) In the Customer Column we filled the missing values with the value 'Unknown'.
6) We removed rows with missing price because are assumed to be invalid and excluded.
7) Transactions with non-positive prices are not included in the FACT_SALES table.A non-positive price may indicate invalid, missing, or promotional transactions, which should not be included in our product dimension.
The most recent product description is used
8)If a product appears multiple times with different descriptions, the latest available description (based on transaction date) is considered.
9)Some transactions in raw_data appear to be duplicates when comparing only INVOICE, PRODUCT and QUANTITY.The original data includes a timestamp in the date field, which was removed when populating FACT_SALES.
Multiple transactions for the same invoice and product may occur at different times on the same day.Some invoices may contain multiple purchases of the same item throughout the day.
Even if multiple records appear to be duplicates at the date level, they may represent separate transactions that occurred at different times within the same day.
This ensures that all sales transactions are retained without unintentionally losing valid data.
